C# has introduced enhanced GC-free programming capabilities through advanced features such as memory safety mechanisms, non-GC-based data structures, and smart pointers. These innovations strengthen C#'s position in the realm of high-performance programming, making it more competitive with languages like C/C++ and Rust. 
1.  MemorySafetyWithoutGC: Introduces Rust-like memory safety features to C#'s unmanaged code, greatly enhancing safety and correctness. (This feature is still in its early development stages.)  
2.  MoreUnmanagedTypes: For usage instructions, refer to the docs.txt file located in the MoreUnmanagedTypes folder.  
    1.  UnmanagedString: Implements struct-based strings in C# that do not rely on the garbage collector (GC).
